Visualizing The Price of a Used Laptop
======================================

This is a pretty quick hack, shoot me an email if you any issues or questions:

To crunch the data you will need at least:

  * perl
  * python
  * numpy
  * a web server (not included)

To gather the feed data from craigslist, you will need

  * rssdrop (http://search.cpan.org/~acg/rssdrop/)

Or you could use

  * rss2email (http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/)

They key thing is that you accumulate rss feed items from a craigslist search into a Maildir. See rssdrop.config for the feed setup. You should fetch the feed and its items periodically eg with a cron job.

To crunch the data, just do

  make 

There's no incremental data rebuild at the moment, dependencies are not declared, there's no "make clean" target, blah blah blah caveat caveat caveat.
